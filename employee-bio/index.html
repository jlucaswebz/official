				<p>Judge Judy was born in Brooklyn, NY, October 21, 1942 as Judith Blum.  She was the <strong>ONLY</strong> woman in a class of 126 students at American University's Washington College of Law, finishing her law degree at New York Law School. New York City Mayor Ed Koch appointed her judge in 1982, and she was profiled for her hard-hitting courtroom tactics on 60 Minutes in 1993. Judge Judy first appeared nationally in 1996, and it is still watched by 10 million people daily.</p>

				<p>In 1965, Judy obtained her law degree, passed the New York bar exam, and took a job as a corporate lawyer for a cosmetics firm. Dissatisfied with the role of a corporate lawyer, she left within two years to raise two children, Jamie and Adam. In 1972, a friend from law school told her of a job opening in the New York courts. She took the job and found herself in the role of prosecutor for the family court system. She prosecuted juvenile crime, domestic violence, and child abuse cases. She was quickly recognized as a sharp, no-nonsense attorney.</p>
